## Introduction to MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas
### Hands-on Workshop
#### Overview


### Required Prerequisites

* To use MongoDB Atlas, you **must** be able to make outgoing requests from your computer
to MongoDB Atlas services which will be running on port 27017.  Please confirm that port
27017 is not blocked by checking with [PortQuiz](http://portquiz.net:27017/).

* Complete [Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). This involves creating an Atlas account, creating your first
free tier cluster, and setting up the appropriate security credentials

* Load Sample data into your cluster by following the [Insert and View Data in Your Cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/insert-data-into-your-cluster/)
section of the Getting Started Guide.

* Download/Install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).  At the moment,
the most recent version of MongoDB Compass is 1.20.3 (Stable).

* Verify the sample databases/collections have been successfully loaded into your
MongoDB Atlas cluster by using either MongoDB Compass or the [Data Explorer](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/data-explorer/index.html)
tool that is part of the MongoDB Atlas User Interface.
